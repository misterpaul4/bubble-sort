# Bubble Sort

> Implementation of the bubble sort algorithm using Ruby

## Built With
- Ruby

## Getting Started
clone the repository to your machine then navigate to the directory. Run the code and call the methods with an array parameter

1. bubble_sort(Array)

2. bubble_sort_by(Array) {|element, next_element| element <=> next_element}
  a positive return value from the block will sort the array

### Milestones
- To build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array.
- To create a similar method called #bubble_sort_by which sorts an array by accepting a block. And to use yield inside the method definition to accomplish this. The block will have two arguments that represent the two elements of the array that are currently being compared.
